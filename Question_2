1)Remove does not have an O(1) time complexity, it has a O(n) time complexity 
since it has to itterate through a loop n times, to get rid of the first componet;
	for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
		q[i]=q[i+1];
	}
get does have an O(1) time complexity since it just needs to access to the array 
once to get the ith value:

	q[i];

2)Add achieves an time complexity of O(1), since it just inserts at the back of the
 array.
	q[++size]=a;

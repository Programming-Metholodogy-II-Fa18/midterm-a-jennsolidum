1)The code does not achive the time complexity O(logN), instead it uses brute force,
tod find the values:
	while(a[i]<value){
		i++;
	}
there fore the best case time complexity would be O(1) if the element being searched for
is in the beginning of the document and the worse case time complexity would be O(N).
